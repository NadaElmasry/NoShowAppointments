# NoShowAppointments
This project explores No-show appointments dataset on brazilian patients. The dataset includes variables about diabetes, alcoholism, handicap, hypertension, neighbourhood, age, and gender of patients. It includes the scdueled day for the appointment and the actual appointment day, whether or not the patient is enrolled in the Bolsa Familia program (Scholarship column), and wether or not the patient received an SMS (SMSReceived column). The last column represents wether or not the patient showed up for the appointment.

The goal from the analysis preformed in this project is to identify factors that affect whether the patients show up to their appointment or not and therefore be able to predict if a future patient will show up for their appointment.
